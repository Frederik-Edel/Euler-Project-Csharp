            Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
            1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
            By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

            List<float> nums = new List<float>() {1,2};
            float num = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < 30; i++)
                nums.Add(nums[nums.Count-1] + nums[nums.Count-2]);
            foreach (float i in nums)
                if ((i/2 % 1) == 0)
                    num += i;
            Console.Write(num);
